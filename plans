- make music playing thing that logs any time current playing state changes, and what point in the song/what song. log should be usable programmatically
- make music tagging thing that allows editing tags for song currently playing
    - positive inclusion, positive inclusion, negative data
- make music tagging storage thing that somewhat-reliably stores tags for songs, ideally in some very simple data format
    - load music tags from id3 data into music tag database
- make music next-song selection
- make music tag prediction thing
    - with blocks?
    - load tags from tag database
    - load music data from disk somewhat intelligently? branch prediction problem lol
    - load music data with [insert library here]
    - architecture ideas:
        - fft thing -> conv (10x10 x10 relu or whatever) -> maxpool /3 -> conv (10x10 x10 relu or whatever) -> maxpool /5 -> conv to 1xn -> simplify -> self-recurrent fc -> self-recurrent fc -> discounted prediction
        - audio stream -> conv ... not sure, need to test this out
        - combine elements of above two so it can learn to use either?
            - this will probably do pretty well too? I'm unsure how well convnets work with position independence
        - none of these seem likely to be able to learn tunes
    - fft ideas:
        - log thing
        - sharded fft, with rolling 2d frequency map composed of multiple levels of fft
        - rolling single fft, strided across the input stream
- make skip point prediction thing?
- make play count prediction thing?
- make skip count prediction thing?
- make skip ratio prediction thing?

next actions:

[@] make music playing thing that logs any time current playing state changes, and what point in the song/what song.
    - save stuff to ~/.musicdata?
[@] figure out fft
[ ] make music tagging storage thing that somewhat-reliably stores tags for songs, ideally in some very simple data format
    - load music tags from id3 data into music tag database
    - independent of mpd - filename?
        - would depending on mpd be easier? voi? halp how do I voi
    - save to ~/.musicdata or whereever
[ ]

other stuff:
    - copying-to-sm cron job for data that is at high risk of overwrite (bashrc, music data, etc)
